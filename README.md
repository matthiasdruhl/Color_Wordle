# Color_Wordle
First project of 2024 RAFB 402 SWEG Internship
Created a game utilizing raspberry pi's that was essentially wordle but limited the inputs to 4 colors
Accessed these colors using buttons attached to the Raspberry Pi through a breadboard
A corresponding light would flash on a different breadboard when the button was pushed
